## Docs

TODO: generate API documentation with TypeDoc

## Features

- Simplicity: no callbacks, no asynchronous code, no functional nor inmutable complications 

## Motivation

- Other client state managers like Redux are verbose and complicated (mutability is easier and simpler than inmutability)
- Other client state mangers like Redux reinvent the wheel. State management is an issue solved decades ago in backends with transactional relational databases.
- The intention of MetaphaseJS is to apply the same techniques of server state management to client-side apps.
